# Telecom_Churn_Case_Study
The primary objective of this project is to leverage customer-level data analysis and predictive modeling in the telecom industry to reduce customer churn. Specifically, the goal is to identify and target high-risk churn customers, ultimately maximizing customer retention. By developing effective churn prediction models and identifying key indicators of churn, our aim is to help the telecom company retain its high-profit customers, thereby reducing the annual churn rate and optimizing customer acquisition costs.

The aim is to build and evaluate multiple classification models to identify the best model for the exercise
